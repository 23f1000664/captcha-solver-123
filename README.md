# Captcha Challenge Interface This project provides a simple, responsive HTML application designed to present a captcha challenge to the user. It can display an image from a URL parameter or default to a local image, allowing users to input their solution. ## Features - **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a clean and adaptable layout across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). - **Dynamic Image Loading:** Displays captcha images provided via a URL query parameter (`?url=...`) or falls back to a default local image (`sample.png`). - **User Input & Validation:** Provides an input field for users to enter the captcha text and offers immediate feedback on correctness. - **Single-File Application:** All HTML, CSS (via Tailwind CDN), and JavaScript are contained within a single `index.html` file for easy deployment. ## Usage 1. **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. 2. **Default Captcha:** By default, the application will display the `sample.png` image. 3. **Custom Captcha Image:** To display a different captcha image, append a `url` query parameter to the URL in your browser's address bar. **Example:** If your `index.html` is hosted at `http://localhost:8000/index.html`, you can use: `http://localhost:8000/index.html?url=https://example.com/path/to/your/image.png` 4. **Solve the Captcha:** * Examine the displayed image. * Enter the text you see in the input field. * Click the "Submit" button. * The application will provide feedback on whether your input was correct or not. For the default `sample.png`, the expected answer is "ADURB". ## Development This application is built using standard web technologies: - **HTML5:** For structure. - **Tailwind CSS:** For styling and responsiveness (included via CDN). - **JavaScript (ES6):** For dynamic behavior and input handling. ## License This project is open-sourced under the MIT License.
